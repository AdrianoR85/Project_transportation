## How to Connect AWS S3 to Databricks

### S3 Bucket Setup
An S3 bucket is a container used to store files (objects) in the cloud.

### 🏗️ How it's structured
Inside the Amazon S3:

```
Bucket
|___Folder
    |____Object(file or folder)
         |_____ Data + Metabata.
```

### **🚢 How to create a Bucket:**
1. Gi to **AWS Console**
2. Open S3
3. Click **"Create bucket"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Bucket name**: must be globally unique
   - **Region**: Choose close to your data processing
5. Keep **Block all public access** enabled (recommended)
6. Click **Create bucket**

### **📁 How to create a folder:**
1. Open your bucket in S3
2. Click **Creata folder**
3. Enter a name in **Folder name**
4. Click **Create**

### **📄 How to insert files:**
1. Open your folder in bucket
2. Drag and Drop your files or click **Add files** to insert the files.
3. Click **Upload**

### **🔗 How to connect to Databricks:
1. Go to Catalog in Databricks
2. Click **External locations** in ⚙️
3. Click **Create external location**
4. Click **AWS Quickstart (Recommendend)** and after **Next**
5. Enter the **Bucket Name** (URL: s3://your_bucket_name)
6. Click **Generate new token** and copy it.
7. Click **Launch in Quickstart**
8. On the window that opened, past the token in **Databricks Pernsonal Access Token**,
9. Enable *I acknowlegde...* in the bottom of the page
10. click **Create stack**
